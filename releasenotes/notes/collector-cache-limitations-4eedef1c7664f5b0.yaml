issues:
  - As part of Rocky fast-failover support, vitrage-graph is now reloaded from
    the database. This causes an issue with datasources using caches, that can
    become outdated in two cases
    - After vitrage-graph restart. This is handled by the consistency service.
    - If more than one vitrage-collector is used.
    Please avoid running multiple vitrage-collector services.
